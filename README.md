# The Hill Climbing Algorithm

Hill Climbing (HC) algorithm is an iterative search method that aims to find a point in the search space that maximises some objective function (fitness).
The HC algorithm starts off at some random point in the search space.
It then looks randomly at its close neighbours until it find one with a better fitness.
The hill climbing algorithm then continues searching for improvement from this new point.


The idea is that the algorithm locates points that lead up (or down) a slope in the fitness space.
This is rather like the analogy of a hill walker trying to climb up a hill in the fog.
They feel around themselves until they find a nearby direction that goes up.
They then move to this higher point and continue searching.
